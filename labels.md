# Elaboration of Gaiety
<aside style="float:right"><a href="/gayquiz"><img src="/gayquiz/resultdark.png" alt="I'm GAY! Find out whether you're gay with THE GAY QUIZ!"></a></aside>
As you know from my [About Page](/about), my pronouns are she|they (she/her and they/them are both fine; use either) and I'm an asexual aromantic demigirl.  
I'm gay! in the sense of generally queer. also in the sense of "most straight people wouldn't do this"

## Attraction
I'm asexual; I experience no sexual attraction. I don't want to have sex either; ew. Sometimes I even forget sex exists. (Although I can forget basically anything exists).

Of course, sexual attraction isn't the only type of attraction or love. I love my friends, I love cool-looking things (like this Web site), and I love hugs and cuddles!
### Aromantic
I experience no romantic attraction. (Except the one time I did.
However, since I still have no clue what romantic attraction is and relate most to aromantic experiences, I'm continuing to use the label aromantic.)

I think I'm now at the point where romanticity is entirely orthogonal to my concerns.
Some stuff I want to do is considered "romantic" and some isn't, but it doesn't matter to me whether romantic attraction's present.  
I've had trouble trying to figure out the difference between romantic and platonic love, but hey I can just do stuff without this distinction!
(except when it's relevant to others. "no romo" is an excellent phrase for communicating one's lack of romantic intent.)

I've fallen in love 1 time. Still have no clue what romance is afterwards.  
So far, all data would suggest I am immune to heartbreak, though this is from a limited sample size of 1.

The following info doesn't necessarily apply anymore but I'm keeping it because it's been useful:
> I don't actively seek out romance either; I'm fine without it. To compare romance to free cake for some reason, I don't actively look to get free cake, but if I get free cake,
> that's pretty cool. And if I eat all the free cake and there is no free cake left, that's completely fine and understandable.
> 
> Any "romantic" thing I would do romantically is also a thing I'd do platonically. As such, it's *very difficult to quantify the difference between romantic and platonic love*.
> Like it's a difference in... happiness intensity... and how do you go about quantifying happinessâ€½
> 
> Since I have determined it is not possible to tell if and when my romantic attraction will end, I think it's important for any romantic groupings setting up infrastructure to make sure they have a plan for if the relationship ends; even if it never ends, it's better to be prepared.

## demigirl
My gender's partially girl. The remaining part is just sort of `null`. I don't know what the proportions of these parts are.  
You can call me femail when i'm sending an email :p
