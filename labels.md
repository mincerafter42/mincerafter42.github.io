Hi! If you're here, you might have noticed [my snazzy pride flag GIF](/assets/ident-8831.gif) and want to know more about the labels I use in it. Or you want your own pride flag GIF. Either is possible.

## Label definitions
wow cool it's some labels!  
Labels allow me to not explain in this much detail every time if you already know a label's definition!
* I'm **aro-spec**, which is an abbreviation for I am on the aromantic spectrum; I experience little to no romantic attraction, having experienced it for either 0 or 1 person. The person is my girlfriend and we love each other very much regardless of what type of attraction this is.
* I'm **asexual**, meaning I don't experience sexual attraction.
* I'm a **demigirl**, meaning my gender is partially but not wholly feminine. The remaining part of my gender is kind of `null`
* I'm **non-binary**, meaning my gender is neither 100% male or female 100% of the time. (Yes, there is some overlap between labels and that's OK!)
* I'm **trans**, meaning my gender is not what people thought it was when I was born, because people make assumptions about babies' genders before the babies even know gender is a thing.

## How to get your own pride flag GIF
You can't! Well, you can, but there isn't a large library of templates for quick and easy assembly or anything.  
The GIF was made entirely by _me!_ using [Gnu Image Manipulation Program](https://gimp.org) so you could use it or another image editor to make your own GIF.
