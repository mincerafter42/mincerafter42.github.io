# Elaboration of Gaiety
<aside style="float:right"><a href="/gayquiz"><img src="/gayquiz/resultdark.png" alt="I'm GAY! Find out whether you're gay with THE GAY QUIZ!"></a></aside>
As you know from my [About Page](/about), my pronouns are she|they (she/her and they/them are both fine; use either) and I'm asexual, aromantic & non-binary.  
I'm gay! in the sense of generally queer. also in the sense of "most straight people wouldn't do this".

## Asexuality

I'm the type of asexual who doesn't want sex and generally avoids explicit sexual content.

## Aromanticism

I'm the type of aromantic who might do some stuff considered "romantic" (for example, [cuddles](/cuddle )), but do it platonically. ("No romo" is an excellent phrase for communicating one's lack of romantic intent.)

## Gendered words

As mentioned before, my pronouns are she/her or they/them. Both are equally preferred.

Generally, I'm fine with being referred to by feminine terms (woman, lady, gal) as well as gender-neutral terms (person, adult, gay). (For the purposes of this Viatrix, "gay" is the gender-neutral form of "guy"/"gal".)

If you must refer to me by a title à la "Mr"/"Ms", choose the first available item on this list:

1. No title
2. "Misc." (short for Miscellaneous)
3. "Miss" (should only be needed if you're some kind of old computer database)

If you must refer to my by an honofiric à la "sir"/"ma'am", choose the first available item on this list:

1. No honorific
2. "madam" (not "ma'am")
