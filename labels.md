# Elaboration of Gaiety
As you know from my [About Page](/about), my pronouns are she|they. (she/her and they/them are both fine; use either)
I'm <abbr title="experiencing no sexual attraction">asexual</abbr> and <abbr title="experiencing little to no romantic attraction">aro-spec</abbr>.<br>
I'm a <abbr title="partially girl">demigirl</abbr>, putting me under the <abbr title="Being neither 100% male 100% of the time nor 100% female 100% of the time">non-binary</abbr> and <abbr title="being a gender other than what you were assigned at birth (because people make assumptions about babies' genders before the babies even know gender is a thing)">trans</abbr> umbrellas.

## Attraction
I'm asexual; I experience no sexual attraction. I don't want to have sex either; ew. Sometimes I even forget sex exists. (Although I can forget basically anything exists).

Of course, sexual attraction isn't the only type of attraction or love. I love my friends, I love cool-looking things (like this Web site), and I love hugs and cuddles!
### Aro-spec
I experience almost no romantic attraction. Almost.

My particular flavour of aro-spec seems to be such that my experiences with romance are quite different from the norm.
I fall in love very rarely (only 1 time so far). I might be demiromantic.  
So far, all data would suggest I am immune to heartbreak, though this is from a limited sample size of 1.

I don't actively seek out romance either; I'm fine without it. To compare romance to free cake for some reason, I don't actively look to get free cake, but if I get free cake,
that's pretty cool. And if I eat all the free cake and there is no free cake left, that's completely fine and understandable.

Any "romantic" thing I would do romantically is also a thing I'd do platonically. As such, it's *very difficult to quantify the difference between romantic and platonic love*.
Like it's a difference in... happiness intensity... and how do you go about quantifying happinessâ€½

Since I have determined it is not possible to tell if and when my romantic attraction will end, I think it's important for any romantic groupings setting up infrastructure to make sure they have a plan for if the relationship ends; even if it never ends, it's better to be prepared.

*[demiromantic]: only crushing on one's friends

## demigirl
My gender's partially girl. The remaining part is just sort of `null`. I don't know what the proportions of these parts are.  
You can call me femail when i'm sending an email :p
