Want to contact me? You can [e-mail me](mailto:viatrix-2@purelymail.com).  
I have a [PGP public key](/public-key.asc) if you're the sort to ask for one.

Here's some [spam poison](https://spampoison.32bit.cafe) to deter spambots from finding my e-address.

## Why email?
I think e-mail is the best online communication medium because it's the one people are most likely to have.  
More people use e-mail than <i>[insert other service here]</i>. In fact, <i>[insert other service here]</i> likely requires its users to have e-mail addresses.  
E-mail is also decentralized and has open standards, leading to the wide availability of e-mail providers and clients.
