title: Contact me

Recently I set up a guestbook, but even more recently the guestbook service I was using appears to have imploded. :p  
Thus, here's just a form to send me a private message (thanks sadgrl.online for the idea)

<form action="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/971894887425392680/DDWlT39qJCaPsQDOAe_ngc4lMu5_qelGeISIEf4vdVF-lS0UMp3IUdo5fpxyiZAqnO-k?wait=true" method="post">
<label>Message (uses Markdown) <br><textarea name="content" minlength="1" maxlength="2000"></textarea></label><br>
If you want a reply, make sure to include your contact information in the message.<br>
<input type="submit">
<input type="hidden" name="flags" value="4">
</form>
