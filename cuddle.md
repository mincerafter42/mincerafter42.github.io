I love cuddling! I want to cuddle my friends! (but some of them don't want cuddles so I won't cuddle them) (and some of them aren't within cuddling distance)

Of course, this website is part of the [Cuddler Webring](https://cuddler-webring.netlify.app/).

What's a webring, you might ask? Well, imagine a bunch of cuddlers are sitting in a loop, and each cuddler is patting the head of the one on their left and of the one on their right.
I want to do this ðŸ¥º  
(And each cuddler represents a web site; each headpat represents a hyperlink.) :p

## Cuddly geometry
<i>Trigonometry? In your cuddles? It's more likely than you think!</i>

<p markdown=1><time datetime="2022-04-28">Recently</time>, a session of virtual cuddling led to a hidden trigonometry problem! dun dun dun  
If a person is leaning on another person, *how far will the person have to move their head to give the other person a little kiss on the cheek?*
Of course this depends on the angle of the leaning and the heights of the people and we need to use *math!*</p>

To prevent such math from being needed *during* cuddling, perhaps cuddlers should precalculate some cuddly constants :p

## Cuddly images
Cuddle-related images which I use in text-based communication; perhaps you will too.

Susan: Ellen, I presume?
Ellen: Yep!
Susan: "Glomp"?
Ellen: You know, like, a big hug...

Good for introducing the concept of a glomp. From <i>[El Goonish Shive](https://www.egscomics.com/comic/2005-03-30)</i>.

Go to the [cuddle jukebox](jukebox) to hear some nice cuddly songs I've found.
