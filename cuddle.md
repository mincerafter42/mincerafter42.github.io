I love cuddling! I want to cuddle my friends! (but some of them don't want cuddles so I won't cuddle them) (and some of them aren't within cuddling distance)

Of course, this website is part of the [Cuddler Webring](https://cuddler-webring.netlify.app/).

What's a webring, you might ask? Well, imagine a bunch of cuddlers are sitting in a loop, and each cuddler is patting the head of the one on their left and of the one on their right.
I want to do this ðŸ¥º  
(And each cuddler represents a web site; each headpat represents a hyperlink.) :p

## Cuddly geometry
<i>Trigonometry? In your cuddles? It's more likely than you think!</i>

<p markdown=1><time datetime="2022-04-28">Recently</time>, a session of virtual cuddling led to a hidden trigonometry problem! dun dun dun  
If a person is leaning on another person, *how far will the person have to move their head to give the other person a little kiss on the cheek?*
Of course this depends on the angle of the leaning and the heights of the people and we need to use *math!*</p>

To prevent such math from being needed *during* cuddling, perhaps cuddlers should precalculate some cuddly constants :p

## Cuddly images
Cuddle-related images which I use in text-based communication; perhaps you will too.

Susan: Ellen, I presume?
Ellen: Yep!
Susan: "Glomp"?
Ellen: You know, like, a big hug...

Good for introducing the concept of a glomp. From <i>[El Goonish Shive](https://www.egscomics.com/comic/2005-03-30)</i>.

## A cuddly song {#a-cup-of-coffee-a-sandwich-and-you}
I found the song <i>A Cup of Coffee, A Sandwich, and You</i> (1925); I think it's a nice cuddly song.  
Here's the lyrics, and you can [download the melody (MIDI, not made by me)](assets/a-cup-of-coffee-a-sandwich-and-you.mid):

> In the movie plays of nowadays  
> a romance always must begin in June;  
> tales in magazines have all their scenes  
> of love laid in a garden 'neath the moon,  
> but I don't miss  
> that kind of bliss;  
> what I want is this:  
> A cup of coffee, a sandwich, and you,  
> a cozy corner, a table for two,  
> a chance to whisper, and cuddle, and coo,  
> with lots of hugging and kissing in view.  
> I don't need music, lobster, or wine  
> whenever your eyes look into mine.  
> The things I long for are simple and few:  
> a cup of coffee, a sandwich, and you.

(I don't actually drink coffee, nor frequently eat sandwiches, nor experience romantic attraction, but i like the affection & the sentiment)
