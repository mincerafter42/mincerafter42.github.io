title: Other Web Sites
---
On this page you can find links to other websites. These are in fact not my websites. They are the websites of other people, which I am listing here because of some connection to them, even if the connection is just "I think this website is cool". This is not a complete comprehensive list of websites I think are cool.

And now, a message from _the future!_ (relative to when this page was first made):  
I added buttons linking to these sites in the sidebar. Only TCoD already had a button so I made the rest.

**Maplestrip's Maple Tree** is the website of my friend Maplestrip. We both read the webcomic El Goonish Shive (found in this very list) and have recorded together on a few podcast episodes.

**El Goonish Shive** is a webcomic by Dan Shive that's been going since 2002. It has magic! And gender! Does it have magic genders? Not sure what that even means. Does it have gender-related magic? Yes. Does it have plot? Yes. Lots of plot. Does it have [an emotional page from 2014 that helped me and many others come out](https://www.egscomics.com/comic/2014-07-01)? Yes. The evolution of the comic has been generally regarded as "it gets better".
- ## [The Cave of Dragonflies](https://dragonflycave.com)

**The Cave of Dragonflies** is a website I found in the early 2010s. It is very much a Pokémon website, with info about Pokémon games as well as interactive content utilising the power of JavaScript, and a bit about websites themselves. This was great for early-2010s me because they lived and breathed Pokémon. Breathing Pokémon may have been unhealthy for my respiratory system.
