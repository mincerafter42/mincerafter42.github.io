title: Interesting Links

On this page you can find links to websites which I think are cool or useful or just interesting. This is not a complete comprehensive list.  
As a guideline for websurfers, I have attempted to rate these sites with [Mab's Land's Web ratings](http://www.mabsland.com/Adoption.html).
(If there's no rating, that means I haven't tried to rate it)
If a webpage conatins its own content warnings those should take precedence over mine.
