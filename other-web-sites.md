title: Cool/Useful Links

On this page you can find links to websites which I think are cool or useful. This is not a complete comprehensive list.  
As a guideline for websurfers, I have attempted to rate these sites with [Mab's Land's Web ratings](http://www.mabsland.com/Adoption.html).
(If there's no rating, that means I haven't tried to rate it)
If a webpage conatins its own content warnings those should take precedence over mine.

(14) [El Goonish Shive](https://egscomics.com),
a webcomic by Dan Shive that's been going since 2002. It has magic! And gender! Does it have magic genders? Not sure what that even means. Does it have gender-related magic? Yes. Does it have plot? Yes. Lots of plot. Does it have [an emotional page from 2014 that helped me and many others come out](https://www.egscomics.com/comic/2014-07-01)? Yes. The evolution of the comic has been generally regarded as "it gets better".

## Other cool sites
- ![](/assets/caveofdragonflies-banner.jpg){:style="float:right"}
(G; some higher-rated content which provides its own warnings) [The Cave of Dragonflies](https://dragonflycave.com),
a website I found in the early 2010s. It is very much a Pokémon website, with info about Pokémon games as well as interactive content utilising the power of JavaScript, and a bit about websites themselves. This was great for early-2010s me because they lived and breathed Pokémon. Breathing Pokémon may have been unhealthy for my respiratory system.
- {:style="clear:right"} (I haven't checked it all) [Ultimate List of ASCII Art Sites](https://web.archive.org/web/20010406061744if_/http://www.geocities.com:80/SoHo/2695/links.htm), a cool piece of Internet history.
