title: Other Web Sites
---
On this page you can find links to other websites. These are in fact not my websites. They are the websites of other people, which I am listing here because of some connection to them, even if the connection is just "I think this website is cool". This is not a complete comprehensive list of websites I think are cool.

[Webcomics](/webcomics) are on a separate page.

## Friends
I'd make this section its own page if I knew of more than one friend with a website. I have many friends but they don't all have websites.
- [Maplestrip's Maple Tree](http://maplestrip.space)  
My friend Maplestrip. We both read the webcomic El Goonish Shive (found in this very list) and have recorded together on a few podcast episodes.

## Cool sites
- ![](/assets/caveofdragonflies-banner.jpg){:style="float:right"}
[The Cave of Dragonflies](https://dragonflycave.com),
a website I found in the early 2010s. It is very much a Pokémon website, with info about Pokémon games as well as interactive content utilising the power of JavaScript, and a bit about websites themselves. This was great for early-2010s me because they lived and breathed Pokémon. Breathing Pokémon may have been unhealthy for my respiratory system.
- {:style="clear:right"} [Ultimate List of ASCII Art Sites](https://web.archive.org/web/20010406061744if_/http://www.geocities.com:80/SoHo/2695/links.htm), a cool piece of Internet history. (**Disclaimer**: ASCII art linked from this page may contain content of a nature I would not put on this website)
