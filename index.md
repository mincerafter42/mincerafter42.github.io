Hi, I'm Vivi. That's short for Viatrix, and long for Vi. Or, the absolute shortest, **V**. In the <abbr title="International Phonetic Alphabet">IPA</abbr> those are written as /vijɐtɻɪks/, /vivi/, /vi/ at least in my dialect.  
I'm also known as mincerafter42 on other platforms, so you can call me mincerafter42, mincerafter, or mince.

My pronouns are she\|they. (she/her or they/them are both ok; you can use either.) [![I'm aro-spec, a demigirl, trans, non-binary, and asexual.](/assets/ident-8831.gif)](/labels)

Some things I like:
- I like making cool stuff digitally. (Things like programs, images, audio, just anything that's cool and that I have the capacity to make)
- I like cuddles.
- I have very casual interests in home textile crafts.
- I enjoy linguistics recreationally (and who doesn't these days, am I right? no; it's likely i'm just in a bubble of recreational linguists).
- The World Wide Web is vast and expansive, and I like it when I find cool pages I'm interested in.

Here on this blog you will find stuff that I do! Some of it is quite random!
