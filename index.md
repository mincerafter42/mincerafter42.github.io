Hi, I'm Vivi. That's short for Viatrix, and long for Vi. Or, the absolute shortest, **V**. In the <abbr title="International Phonetic Alphabet">IPA</abbr> those are written as /vijɐtɻɪks/, /vivi/, /vi/ at least in my dialect.  
I'm also known as mincerafter42 on other platforms, so you can call me mincerafter42, mincerafter, or mince.

My pronouns are she|they. (she/her or they/them are both ok; you can use either. Check out the [Pronoun notation](/2021/06/16/pronoun-notation)!)  
To learn more about my gender, and romantic & sexual orientation, [visit the Labels page](/labels), also available in the header menu.

Here on this blog you will find stuff that I do! Some of it is quite random!  
You can be notified of new posts through **syndication feeds.**. To learn why that's the only way available, you can read about syndication feeds in [the Site Setup page](/site-setup).

You can use the links in the header menu, at the top of the page, to navigate around my blog.
