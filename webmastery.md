# Resources for Webmasters
I'm a webmaster; one who is in charge of a website. Here are some resources for webmasters or aspiring webmasters!

## External resources
Here are some useful resources if you wish to learn <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, the language of the Web, or if you wish to improve your existing HTML skills.

- [The Cave Of Dragonflies' HTML guide](https://www.dragonflycave.com/html-guide) (HTML+CSS tutorial; great for beginners)
- [Mozilla Developer Network's HTML Resources](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) (tutorial and references)
- [HTML Living Standard, Edition for Web Developers](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev/) (definitive reference)

## Webmastery tutorials I've made:
