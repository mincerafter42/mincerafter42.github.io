# Resources for Webmasters
I'm a webmaster; one who is in charge of a website. I have also been called an HTML goddess and a powerful CSS mage :p  
Here are some resources for webmasters or aspiring webmasters!

## External resources
Here are some useful resources if you wish to learn <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, the language of the Web, or if you wish to improve your existing HTML skills.

- [The Cave Of Dragonflies' HTML guide](https://www.dragonflycave.com/html-guide) (HTML+CSS tutorial; great for beginners)
- [Mozilla Developer Network's HTML Resources](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) (tutorial and references)
- [HTML Living Standard, Edition for Web Developers](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev/) (definitive reference)
- [HTMHell](https://www.htmhell.dev/) common webdev mistakes and how to correct them
- [Can I Use...](https://caniuse.com/) tells you which browsers support which features
- [Web contrast checker](https://contrastchecker.com)
- [Guide to using `alt` text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/)

## Webmastery tutorials I've made:

- [Accessible CSS navigation dropdown](/tutorial/accessible-css-dropdown)
- [How to make a webring](/tutorial/webring) (via setting up a new website on Netlify)
- [Pseudo-Monthly Archives on Jekyll with GitHub Pages](/2020/11/24/pseudo-monthly-archives-on-jekyll-with-github-pages) (only applies to Jekyll with GitHub pages)

## Webhosts
Looking to get your website online? Most webmasters are probably aware of hosts such as Neocities, Netlify, Github Pages, Gitlab pages... but what about niche webhosts which could use more attention?
Well the only one I currently know of is [Furtopia](https://furtopia.org/application.html), wherein websites must primarily focus on furry art.
