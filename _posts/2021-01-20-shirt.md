In an earlier post, [I ordered a custom shirt]({{site.url}}/2020/12/27/a-gift-and-the-subsequent-shirt). I have the shirt now!  
(I actually had it for a while and just didn't get around to sharing it on my blog.)  
<ins datetime="2021-12-18">The design was printed as expected; however, the design appears to be slowly coming off instead of staying on the shirt.</ins>

Someone I know was apparently a critical critic of the first images I took, critiquing the lighting and image compression and focus. Does my room just have bad lighting for photographs?

Here is an image of me in the shirt, with hopefully more decent lighting?

This is the least dramatic face reveal ever.
