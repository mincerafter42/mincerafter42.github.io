I was recently featured on [the podcast Moperville Monthly](https://anchor.fm/maplestrip), a podcast by [Maplestrip](http://maplestrip.space) about [the webcomic El Goonish Shive](https://egscomics.com).  
In this episode we purport to talk about [two arcs beginning on the date of my birth](https://egscomics.com/egsnp/2004-04-13), but is that _really_ what we talk about? Yes, but also other stuff.

You can listen to the episode here:
