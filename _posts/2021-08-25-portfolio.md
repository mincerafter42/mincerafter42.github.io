There's a [portfolio of cool stuff I've made](/portfolio) on this site now! You can access it through the header menu too. A lot of it is stuff that was already on this blog, just because the blog was my main source of even remembering what cool stuff I've done.

I already had the idea of collecting the cool stuff I've done on this blog, and then my counselor was like "you should do it" and now I've done it. If I've missed any cool stuff that I could show to the general public, please let me know.
