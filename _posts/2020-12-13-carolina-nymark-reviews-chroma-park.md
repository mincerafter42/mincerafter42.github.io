After a long time of no Chroma Park news, there's some Chroma Park news!  
[@poena](https://profiles.wordpress.org/poena/) is the accessibility reviewer for [Chroma Park](/2020/10/24/chroma-park/)! (If you'll remember from earlier, the accessibility review is separate from the main review)

This is the point at which the version of Chroma Park on this blog starts to deviate from the version on WordPress.org, since to pass the accessibility review I needed to do such important stuff as softening the gradients for higher color contrast, and changing the visual and focus order to match each other. Maybe I'll keep the blog this way or maybe I'll make it match the WordPress.org version of Chroma Park in the future.

I don't know if the new version passes the accessibility review but I did my best to address everything they mentioned.  
More updates will come sometime, I have no clue when. Quite possibly the year 2021, just in time to be later than the 12th anniversary of Green Park's final release (on 2008-12-31).
