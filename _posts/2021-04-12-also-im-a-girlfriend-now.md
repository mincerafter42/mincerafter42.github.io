Yep, I'm a girlfriend now. With a girlfriend. She is awesome. And I didn't share it on my blog earlier because I am forgetful.

You might be saying "Vivi, I thought you said you were aromantic on [the Labels page](/labels)." And I might have been right because the two of us don't know what kind of attraction we're feeling. Maybe it's [queerplatonic](http://wiki.asexuality.org/Queerplatonic). If it does turn out to be romantic I'll have to update my Labels page and the pride flag gif.

She is adorable and I want to look at her cute face and she makes me so happy (and vice versa), and we'd cuddle if there wasn't an ongoing pandemic.
