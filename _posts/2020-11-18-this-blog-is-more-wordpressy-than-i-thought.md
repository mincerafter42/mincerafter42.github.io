I was recently told that my blog is very WordPressy. This led me to discover that everyone other than me is seeing a big white "Create your own website with WordPress" bar at the top of my blog. I was seeing an entirely different bar.

Looks like this is another fact of the WordPress Free plan, along with occasional ads that apparently are a thing.  
Upgrading to a paid WordPress plan would remove these but that means I, an individual with no source of income, would have to pay money! The blog would be a net loss if I paid for it.  
The cheapest non-free plan is $5/month billed yearly (that's Canadian dollars, because I live in Canada) for a yearly bill of $60. If we compare that to my yearly income of $0 we will find that the WordPress Personal Plan will make me lose money.
