You may be aware of my great friends Willow and Luna, whom I mentioned in a previous post. Recently I knitted some gifts for them! The gifts are enby flags and they both seem to love them!  
Here you might be asking, "Vivi, what does enby mean?" Enby is a phonetic transcription of the sounds produced by reading the English letters **NB**, which are short for NonBinary. I'm an enby! And so are Willow and Luna!

You might also be asking "Vivi, you can knit?" Yes I can! Just a little though, I don't know a lot about knitting! But I absolutely can knit some rectangles, which is great for the purposes of flags! Here's an image! (hosted externally because this thing is 5 296 298 bytes)

![Two identical wool flags. The flag is made of four horizontal stripes that are, from top to bottom, yellow, white, purple, black.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/307249119498338326/786427617539653682/IMG_9501.JPG)

A challenge I anticipated in these flags is the fact that I would have to link the stripes in some way, otherwise they would just not connect and I would just have four unconnected rectangles at the end. To prevent that, I used a technique that I call "these are actually really small zigzags and not straight lines" which probably has some other name among knitters who actually know the names of stuff.
