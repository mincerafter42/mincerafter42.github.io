As you may know, I am an unemployed minor. But what if I wasn't an unemployed minor? What if I was a not unemployed minor? Or even better, a not unemployed not minor?  
Unfortunately I have basically no clue how getting employed works.

I've found a company which I could apply to, except I couldn't because I didn't know how to.  
Cover letters? CVs? Resum√©s? These are all words which I do not know how to convert into well-formed documents.

There is a great deal of confusion in this area experienced by me. AAAAAAAAA.
