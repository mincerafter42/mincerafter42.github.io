3653 is a cool number. In fact, it'd be the number of days in a period of 10 years containing 3 leap days, perhaps the days 2012-02-29, 2016-02-29, and 2020-02-29.  
You know what else is cool? Vi Hart. (Not to be confused with me, who is also Vi. Vi (Hart)'s name is usually pronounced /v√§i/ but I'm /vi/).

I first watched Vi (Hart)'s content during the 2011-2012 school year. Vi (Hart) makes a lot of mathematics-related videos. Review: Sometimes they go too fast for a 6-year-old to understand.

Recently I decided to rewatch Hart's video [The Gauss Chrismath Special](https://youtu.be/sxnX5_LbBDU) and I realized it was nearly the video's 10th anniversary.  
I had actually already had a vague plan to cover the song at some point (since my name was now also Vi, it'd fit with the roman numerals part) but I figured why not do it right now, for the 10th anniversary?

Potentially of note is that I do not have a lot of musical experience. Not only are there no instruments, occasionally there is audio clipping (though I have tried to reduce the clipping with [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/).)

Here it is, all the words Vi (not me) wrote, sung by Vi (me):
