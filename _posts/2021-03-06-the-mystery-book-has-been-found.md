The [unknown book from the previous post](/2021/03/02/a-book-i-read-once) has been found! Through a small chain of suggestions it was found pretty quickly once I made a post on the subreddit [r/whatsthatbook](https://reddit.com/r/whatsthatbook).

The book is *Parents from Space*. You can [borrow it from the Internet Archive library (account needed)](https://archive.org/details/parentsfromspace0000bowe). I read it in slightly over 2 hours, which was a bit inconvenient because at the end I had to borrow then almost immediately return it.

In addition to the stuff I remembered, *Parents from Space* has
- a plot (which I didn't remember, probably explaining why I couldn't remember the ending)
- other things I didn't remember
- things I did remember but didn't realize they were from the same book
- puns
- puns that 11-year-old me absolutely would not have gotten
- a part that might be a joke or it might just be a tangential paragraph with no jokes in it, I dunno
- allegedly a 13+ age recommendation which I can't find, and which 11-year-old me and the elementary school staff ignored and/or could not find.
- parity asymmetry
