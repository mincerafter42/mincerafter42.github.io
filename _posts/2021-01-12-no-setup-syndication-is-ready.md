Remember No Setup Syndication, my RSS feed reader extension for Chromium and Firefox? It is now done! Or at least in a state I consider done!

The feature set is:
- Works immediately upon installation
- Allows the user to choose RSS feeds
- Displays contents of the chosen RSS feeds in chronological order when the extension is used
- Keep track of the most recent time user used the extension
  - Use this to display a visual difference between read posts and unread posts
  - Also use this to display the number of unread posts in the badge
- Customizable date format
- Support for enclosed media
  - Option to download enclosed media
- Supports both Chromium and Firefox

You can get the [code with installation instructions](https://github.com/mincerafter42/no-setup-syndication) from the GitHub repository.

I was going to submit NSS to the Chrome Web Store, but there's an initial $5 fee! Who do they think I am, some sort of ***employed adult?!*** With ***money?!*** So you can instead install it just by selecting the unpacked file from the chrome://extensions page, with developer mode on (it can be turned off after that).

You can also download the [Firefox version](/assets/no_setup_syndication.xpi) from this page. The installation for it is super easy for me because I can just right-click it and select "Open with Firefox".

Some RSS feeds you might want to start with:
- [This very blog you are reading](/feed.rss)
- [Moperville Monthly](https://anchor.fm/s/1053cd4c/podcast/rss) (I was on it once. Podcasts are a good use of the enclosure feature.)
- [El Goonish Shive](https://www.egscomics.com/comic/rss), a webcomic I'm a fan of. Also has feeds for the [Newspaper section](https://www.egscomics.com/egsnp/rss) and [Sketchbook section.](https://www.egscomics.com/comic/rss)
- [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/rss.xml) (xkcd's never been mentioned on my blog before, but it's a comic I follow)
