I have decided to look into hosting my blog in a way other than using WordPress.com.

Due to the well-known fact that I am an unemployed minor, I can't buy any WordPress plan more expensive than Free.  
This apparently means that in addition to having a large WordPress.com bar at the top of my site, and not being able to use my own theme, I apparently can't even add a simple iframe to my posts because WordPress.com automatically removes iframes!

I am thinking of changing my blog to a static site using a static site generator. What this would mean for the blog is that:
* The URL would change.
* There would be no comments on the posts. (I am OK with this; so far I have only gotten one comment, composed of the string "first".)
* The blog hit counter would probably disappear.
* I'd actually be able to make the blog look how I want
* and put the content I want on the blog

The blog will probably stay at this URL until I fully set it up at another URL so any blog-reading can go uninterrupted.
