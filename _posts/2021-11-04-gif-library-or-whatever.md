ok i made a [gif python library](/assets/gif.py) i guess idk

it can be used to open, edit, and save gifs or whatever  
has more capabilities than an image editor  
previously i was making one-time python scripts to make gifs my image editors couldn't create, heavily referencing the gif specification, but now i can use the library or whatever

is 'library' even the correct teminology or is it called something else idk it's a file with some classes
