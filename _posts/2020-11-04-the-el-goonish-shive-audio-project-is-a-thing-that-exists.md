I don't know how many readers of my blog are familiar with [the webcomic El Goonish Shive](https://egscomics.com), or indeed how many readers of my blog there are, but there's a fan project to make an audio version of EGS, to have voices for the characters reading the dialogue in the comic.  
And here's another fact: I might be the voice of Ellen in the aforementioned audio project, pretty cool and neat!

<figure class="alignleft" style="width:232px"><img class="size-full" src="https://mincerafter42.files.wordpress.com/2020/11/egs_ellen.jpg" alt="Ellen from the webcomic El Goonish Shive. She has brown shoulder-length hair, light skin, and is wearing a dark blue shirt." width="232" height="232" /> This is Ellen, from the webcomic El Goonish Shive. Could she sound exactly like my normal speaking voice? Maybe.</figure>

I auditioned using _my normal speaking voice!_ and it seems like at least one person thinks _my normal speaking voice!_ could be Ellen's voice.  
I have had very little experience with voice acting so I could probably benefit from a director. The only thing I voice acted in in recent memory is my role as a generic human scream in a NonStampCollector video. [Here's NonStampCollector's video filled with hours of human screams, I'm somewhere in there.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_nL5d9lxJU)  
Ellen is canonically 2 years older than my current age (1 year in the earlier comics) so that's a fact I guess.  
The audio project currently has a number of people and would probably be better if that number was greater.
