[Chroma Park, my WordPress theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/chroma-park/) is now available to the public! That means _you_, right now, could download Chroma Park! (Which 30 people have apparently already done!) Or translate it! Or leave a rating!

As I predicted in my last Chroma Park post, there was no more news until 2021. Green Park, the theme it was based on, has now not had a new update for _12_ years!

Chroma Park took 76 days from the initial submission to its approval, which sounds like a lot, but somehow for a while it was the most recent theme pending approval, and then after that it continued to be the most recent theme that was `accessibility-ready` pending approval. So was 76 days actually pretty fast?
