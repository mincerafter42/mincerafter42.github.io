No, not [the trope Webcomic Time](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WebcomicTime); it's time for me to make a webcomic! What could possibly go wrong?

I wanted to make a webcomic for whatever reason, and armed with decent vector drawing skills I began constructing a plan! I have like 12 comics planned. The plan is also to release comics weekly. I would absolutely be unable to keep up with the workload of a _daily_ comic.

[Observe the comic! (or a mostly empty unstyled page)](/fillbert). I chose the character of Fillbert, who I'd been doodling in my math notes for some time, but is now viewable in glorious <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr>!
