I wanted to have a place to put short form strings, sort of like Tumblr or Twitter but it's just me with my own wacky shenanigans.  
so I made my [Somewhat Shortform/Social Strings page]({{'/ssss/index.xml'|absolute_url}}); it's literally just an RSS feed of short form strings. I moved the quotes from my quotes page there too.
Add it to your feed aggregator if you want more short form content from me.
