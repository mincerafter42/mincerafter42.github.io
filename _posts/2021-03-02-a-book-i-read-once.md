In 2015, I read a book. I can't remember the title of the book, and I can't find evidence of the book online. But I want to find the book again; from what I remember it sounds like a good book.

The book was pretty mind-bendy. Near the beginning these kids discover they're in a story (can't remember how, probably just by observing the story-like elements of the story), and debate about whether they're in a movie or book before determining they're in a book (via the claim that nobody needs to use the bathroom in movies). Then it just continues? but they know they're in a book for the rest of it? cool.  
Later I think there's aliens from a planet called "Earth" when it's translated into English.  
I can't even remember how the book ends.

Why did I make this post? I dunno. Just to show the book exists I guess, if anyone else read and then forgot it. And if someone read and remembers it, please tell me more.
