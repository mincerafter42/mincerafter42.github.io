<time datetime="2020-12-25">Recently</time> I was gifted two issues of a _Linux Pro Magazine_. I had not heard of this magazine before (but apparently it was a good deal because one issue came with a DVD of all the past issues. Now I have all sorts of useful information from the past 20 years, such as that Blender has a premium version that can be purchased for Â£57).

The part relevant to this post is that _Linux Pro Magazine_ publishes [a webcomic called _Elvie_](http://peppertop.com/elvie). (The comic appears to be produced for the magazine and released online at a delay.)  
For me, not all of the jokes in _Elvie_ land. Some of its jokes I find funny while others I don't. I do not endorse bitcoin.

Eventually I encountered [the _Elvie_ #069 comic](http://peppertop.com/elvie/comic/elvie-069), which consists of many shirts with jokes. As with the comic in general, I don't find all of the shirts funny, but there's a lot of them here, and there was one shirt that I found so funny that I actually wanted to own a copy of the shirt.

<span style="padding:.5em;display:inline-block;background-color:#80b3ff;color:#501616;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;font-family:serif;text-align:center;font-size:2em">Web developers <br />
do it with <span style="color:#800000;font-family:monospace;font-style:normal">style</span> <br />
(and <span style="color:#008000;font-family:monospace;font-style:normal">class</span>)</span>  
(If you don't get it then perhaps you would benefit from an introductory guide to Cascading Style Sheets, which I have not provided.)

This shirt was not actually existing or for sale, but fortunately the <abbr title="Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike">CC-BY-SA</abbr> license is completely fine with me copying and redistributing this shirt in the form of a shirt.

I used the custom printing service [RedBubble](https://www.redbubble.com/) to order a shirt with that design (with attribution included of course, in accordance with the license). Redbubble allows users to sell the works they upload, but unfortunately I can't do so because I am unable to get paid, due to PayPal accounts requiring my nonexistent mobile phone number.  
However, I can just distribute the image that I used so others can use it too. It is already the correct size for t-shirts on RedBubble; I don't know about other services' image size requirements.  
<ins datetime="2021-12-18">After obtaining the shirt, the design was printed as expected; however, it appears to be slowly coming off instead of staying on the shirt.</ins>
