I am a programmer. I program stuff, sometimes for very silly reasons.  
I have had experience with Javascript since 2015.  
I have had experience with Scratch since 2016 (and made some pretty good programs with it too).  
You could say I've had experience with PHP since 2020 I guess, since I used some PHP when making a WordPress theme (not the one this blog uses at the time of writing) but I haven't had any formal PHP training or anything.  
Actually, I did have one class of formal Python training back in the 2018-2019 school year, when for reasons related to my high school I attended one day of a college Python class. I think it was just about if statements or something.
