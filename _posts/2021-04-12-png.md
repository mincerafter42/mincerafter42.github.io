I have been animating this video over several weeks, and now it is done.

<video src="/assets/png.mp4" controls><a href="/assets/png.mp4">Download video (13098580 bytes)</a> because your browser down't support the <code>video</code> element.</video>

It's a video about the PNG image format.
The text is taken from the very 1990s-like list of spiffy features from [An informal history of PNG, on the PNG website](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/#history). It was probably written in the actual 1990s.
It is read by my friend flicky and the music is Neon Laser Horizon by Kevin MacLeod of [Incompetech](https://incompetech.com).

Why did I make this? I dunno. I just wanted to. Colour correction has a huge bunch of maths behind it which I did my best to implement in Blender for a few seconds of animation.
