In 2006, the developer Andreas Jacob released a WordPress theme.  
In 2008 (or 2009 depending on your timezone) Andreas released the final version of the theme.  
<a href="https://cordobo.com/free-wordpress-templates/cordobo-green-park/">That theme was Green Park, and it never was updated after 2008... until now!</a>  

<figure class="alignleft" style="width:201px"><img class="size-medium" src="/assets/no hotlinking cordobo.com.jpg" alt="A very small image showing a portion of a screen with bright greenish elements." width="201" height="149"> Andreas, what's up with this tiny image? I can barely see the theme at all, it might as well be in a foreign language!</figure>

In August of 2020, I, Vivi, began the process of improving Green Park!  
I replaced its static images with CSS stylings, which reduced the overall file size and made the elements look just as good on wide displays or displays zoomed in. I also implemented customizable colors, so a user could choose any color they liked for the header, footer, content, and sidebars.  
I made the sidebars optional, so a user could have one or no sidebars if they wanted, and I made the sidebars move themselves to be under the content instead of beside it on thin displays, using modern flexbox technology!  
I updated Green Park to fit <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/required/">the WordPress Theme Review Guidelines</a>, including <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/required/">the Accessibility Guidelines</a> (this required some darker default colors but they could totally be changed to the bright yellowy-green if wanted), and rebranded it as Chroma Park!  
I submitted Chroma Park to <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes">the WordPress Theme Directory</a>. If it passes the manual review, it will be added to the directory.  

<figure class="alignright" style="width:1200px"><img style="height:auto;" class="size-medium" src="https://themes.svn.wordpress.org/chroma-park/0.2/screenshot.png" alt="A large image of the Chroma Park theme, configured with a bright green header, dark green content, red left sidebar, blue right sidebar, and purple footer. The main content is describing screenshot guidelines." width="1200" height="900"> Now that's a theme preview! Of course, I made it delightfully self-referential by including the screenshot guidelines in the screenshot.</figure>

Chroma Park is not in the Theme Directory yet, but I will make more posts about it as it progresses through the review process!
