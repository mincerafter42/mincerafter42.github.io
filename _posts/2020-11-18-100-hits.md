The hit counter of the blog has reached 100! (Don't you dare make a factorial joke, I've seen them for three years now and by now they have lost any humour they started with)

Imma be honest, I don't know how the hit counter counts. Is each hit a unique visitor? Or a loaded page? Or some other combination of criteria? I don't know, but the number is over 100 now. Cool
