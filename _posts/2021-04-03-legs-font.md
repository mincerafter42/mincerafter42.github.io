The L.E.G.S. font is a font made via me tracing the letters in the webcomic El Goonish Shive. Development on it actually started nearly a year ago, on 2020-05-02, but I just didn't consider the possibility of sharing it in a more accessible place until just now.

L.E.G.S. is short for Letterized El Goonish Shive. Yes I picked the name so it would spell a word. In the EGS Discord server I was calling the successive iterations 2LEGS, 3LEGS, 4LEGS, but I dunno that seems a bit impractical for a more public distribution.  
EGS uses a font made by the author that has not been distributed to my knowledge, hence the tracing. I traced only high-definition letters that were like 20px tall or so I think.

Notable things about L.E.G.S are:
- the curly bracket characters { } are instead these little sound effect lines. This is consistent with what Dan the author said when creating the font<sup><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup>.
- the square bracket characters [ ] are instead directional quotation marks ‟ ” . This was a choice by me because the square brackets have never been seen in Dan's font, but both directionless and directional quotation marks have.
- some symbols are not included, despite being known to occur Dan's font, due to no high-resolution versions of them being available to trace.

Sometime afterward, GIMP and some other image editors started displaying the font too thin, for no discernible reason. The only fix I have is
[a thicker version of the L.E.G.S font](/assets/L.E.G.S.B.ttf).

License: I give everyone the rights to do whatever they want with the font except for lying about it. Don't say it came to you in a dream in 1993 and you spent several years designing it to perfection as you travelled through France. That would be an example of a lie. Don't say you forgot where you got it either, because that would be another lie, unless you actually did forget, which is not encouraged.
