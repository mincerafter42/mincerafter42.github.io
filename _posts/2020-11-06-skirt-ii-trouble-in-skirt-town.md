In [a recent post](/2020/10/31/a-skirt-for-my-friend-luna/), I exposited my plan to sew a skirt for my friend Luna. I thought this would be easy. The reason I thought it would be easy was because the previous sewing projects for class had been easy. The reason those were easy was because all I had to do was follow the instructions.

The instructions for the skirt were kinda bad.

Skirt is still being made but these instructions really could benefit from some revision to make them clearer.
