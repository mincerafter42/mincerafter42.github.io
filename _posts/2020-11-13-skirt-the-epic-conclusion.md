Luna has the skirt now!  
They have confirmed it goes spinny  
When asked if they would like to say anything else about the skirt for this very blog, Luna said:

> Skirts with pockets are an innovation in womens fashion that needs to exist

Then I realized I might not have mentioned the pockets yet in the skirt saga (I did in Skirt III). So yes the skirt has pockets, and I picked this skirt pattern in part because of the pockets. Pockets allow for the containment of items.
