This is presumably the conclusion of making a skirt for my friend Amber

The skirt is done.  
It is a skirt that is existing now.  
Due to the fact that this is a Textiles class at school, there will be some waiting time for the teacher to look at how well I made it.  
Spoiler: It's pretty good but it's not perfect. For one thing, one of the pockets is sewn the wrong way but you could only tell that if you were actually looking in the pockets. And in general my sewing skills are not absolutely perfect, especially since my sewing skills are "just happens to be decent at sewing and I don't know why, apparently I have good hand-eye coordination?"  

Well Amber if you're reading this:  
Skirt, coming soon to you  
and if you're not reading this it's still true
