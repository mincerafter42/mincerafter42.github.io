You may remember in an earlier post I mentioned my friend Luna. Well now, imma make a skirt for them.  
You may be wondering "Vivi, you can make a skirt?" and "Why have you decided, at this time, to make a skirt?" The answers are "I sure hope so and to assume I would would be predicted by the data so far" and "I need to sew something for my Textiles class and Luna wants a skirt."  
So far I've got a pattern and fabric and also the other things required by the pattern. The most immediate challenge I'll have is a geometry challenge in which I try to make the stripe design on the fabric line up with the pattern pieces in such a way that it'll look good in the end.  
Sure hope they'll like it
