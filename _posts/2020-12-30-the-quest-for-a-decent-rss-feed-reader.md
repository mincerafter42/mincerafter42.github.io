As you might know, my blog is syndicated using RSS. There are other websites which I wish to know when they post that also syndicate posts with RSS. However, finding an RSS feed reader with the simple functionality I am looking for is surprisingly hard!

Ideally, the RSS feed reader I am looking for would be an extension for my browser, that shows me the posts from the feeds I choose in chronological order. There are many RSS feed reader extensions available for Chromium-based browsers, and none of the ones I tried do this!  
When I install an RSS feed reader I don't want to be distracted by a mandatory setup or account creation or ads or stuff like that! I want to immediately be able to view the posts from the feeds!

This is why I have begun an attempt to create my own RSS feed reader for Chromium-based browsers. This actually brings up an entirely different problem, being the incomplete documentation! Sure, the info I'm looking for is probably somewhere in the documentation, but all the broken links make it difficult to find! And when developers do successfully make an RSS feed reader extension, they decide to add a bunch of inconvenient features? I do not understand why!

I'll probably share the feed reader as soon as it's in any _working_ state, but after that I would probably add ***non-intrusive*** features that ***don't require any setup*** like supporting the separate Atom feeds which are also common, and making it visually interesting.
