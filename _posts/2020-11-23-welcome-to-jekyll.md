__Hey, everyone looking through the archives. Any posts earlier than this were previously hosted on a WordPress.com site.__

OK, now that that's sorted out,  
This blog is now hosted using [the static site generator Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)!  
You might notice it looks remarkably similar to my WordPress theme Chroma Park (previously mentioned on this blog). This is beacause I have thrown together an implementation of Chroma Park using Jekyll. It does not have all the features of the first Chroma Park because I only bothered converting the features I wanted.

Jekyll actually allowed me to implement some features that I couldn't with WordPress, like the fact that the monthly archive on the right uses the ISO 8601 date format. (However there's actually a lot of coding trickery going on with the monthly archive itself due to the limitations of GitHub Pages, so look forward to more about that in a future post.)
