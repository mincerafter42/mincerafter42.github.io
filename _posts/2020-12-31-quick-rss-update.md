Just a quick update on the last post.

I am now considering developing the extension for Firefox first and then porting it to Chromium, the process seems pretty similar both ways but Firefox looks like it actually has complete documentation?  
Also be aware that just like all my projects, nothing is completely guaranteed. (If I stop working on this though, I guess that would mean I am satisfied with how I can follow RSS feeds?)
