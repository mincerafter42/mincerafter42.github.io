00:13.480 --> 00:18.080
It would be crazy if you would cuddle me

00:19.120 --> 00:20.120
(cuddle me)

00:21.640 --> 00:26.200
I feel so hazy when we get cuddly

00:26.200 --> 00:29.120
(cuddly, how you befuddle me)

00:29.640 --> 00:34.160
Don't tire of that wanting to cling to me

00:35.400 --> 00:36.520
(cling to me)

00:37.760 --> 00:42.360
You have the love that means everything to me

00:42.360 --> 00:45.280
('thing to me, you're everything to me)

00:45.960 --> 00:52.560
Love words are sweet, but honey, they only tease

00:53.040 --> 00:56.000
And so, whenever we meet,

00:57.560 --> 01:01.520
If you wanna please me, all you gotta do is squeeze me

01:01.520 --> 01:06.680
Don't whisper words; they only befuddle me

01:07.560 --> 01:08.800
(befuddle me)

01:10.160 --> 01:14.800
Just put those arms around me and cuddle me

01:14.800 --> 01:17.720
(cuddle me, how you befuddle me)

01:18.240 --> 01:24.840
Love words are sweet, but honey, they only tease

01:25.200 --> 01:28.160
And so, whenever we meet,

01:29.800 --> 01:33.760
If you wanna please me, just squeeze, squeeze, squeeze me

01:33.760 --> 01:38.840
Don't whisper words; they only befuddle me

01:40.000 --> 01:41.080
(befuddle me)

01:42.320 --> 01:47.000
Just put those arms around me and cuddle me

01:47.000 --> 01:50.160
(cuddle me, how you befuddle me)

01:50.160 --> 01:54.080
(sing to me, cling to me, you're everything to me)

01:54.640 --> 02:00.880
Oh baby, cuddle me
