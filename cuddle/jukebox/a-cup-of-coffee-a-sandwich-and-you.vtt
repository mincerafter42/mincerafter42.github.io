00:05.960 --> 00:09.520
In the movie plays of nowadays

00:09.520 --> 00:12.920
A romance always must begin in June

00:13.800 --> 00:17.600
Tales in magazines have all their scenes

00:17.600 --> 00:21.640
Of love laid in a garden 'neath the moon

00:22.760 --> 00:26.960
But I don't miss that kind of bliss

00:26.960 --> 00:30.200
What I want is this:

00:30.200 --> 00:38.240
A cup of coffee, a sandwich, and you

00:38.240 --> 00:44.080
A cozy corner, a table for two

00:44.080 --> 00:50.080
A chance to whisper, cuddle, and coo

00:50.080 --> 00:56.320
With lots of huggin' and kissin' in view

00:56.320 --> 01:02.600
I don't need music, lobster, or wine

01:02.600 --> 01:08.880
As long as your eyes look into mine

01:08.880 --> 01:14.960
The things I long for are simple and few

01:14.960 --> 01:19.960
A cup of coffee, a sandwich, and you

02:06.040 --> 02:11.600
A cup of coffee, a sandwich, and you

02:11.600 --> 02:17.320
A cozy corner, a table for two

02:17.320 --> 02:23.040
A chance to whisper, cuddle, and coo

02:23.040 --> 02:28.800
With lots of huggin' and kissin' in view

02:28.800 --> 02:31.240
I don't need music,

02:31.240 --> 02:33.080
(hear that music play)

02:37.360 --> 02:43.400
As long as your eyes look into mine

02:43.400 --> 02:49.200
The things I long for are simple and few

02:49.200 --> 02:58.240
A cup of coffee, a sandwich, and you
