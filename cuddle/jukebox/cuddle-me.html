It would be crazy if you would cuddle me
I feel so hazy when we get cuddly
Don't tire of that wanting to cling to me
You have the love that means everything to me
Love words are sweet, but honey, they only tease
And so, whenever we meet,
If you wanna please me, all you gotta do is squeeze me
Don't whisper words; they only befuddle me
Just put those arms around me and cuddle me
