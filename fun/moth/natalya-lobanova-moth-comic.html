alt="All my friends are getting married.
Meanwhile, I can't stop buying dumb stuff online.

All my friends are buying houses.
Meanwhile, I am consuming the dumb stuff I bought online. {A bottle labelled “Moth Juice”}

All my friends are getting married.
Meanwhile, I am becoming increasingly and worryingly obsessed with bright lights yet entirely averse to daylight.

All my friends are having babies.
Meanwhile...

I have transformed into a half-moth, half-human beast, no longer burdened by the passage of time, mortality, or self-awareness.
And both life-style choices are valid. ❤"></pre>
