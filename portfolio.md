title: Cool stuff I've made
---
I've made some cool stuff. But it's like scattered everywhere. Here I tried to collect the cool stuff I've made. Some of the stuff here has its own blog post on this blog.

This list may be incomplete. If there's a cool thing I did that I forgot about, let me know I guess.

Presented in reverse chronological order.
- [The webcomic Fillbert](https://mincerafter42.github.io/fillbert), an ongoing webcomic with slightly obscure Web technologies featuring this spherical cat and myself and my friends. First comic released 2021-05-24.
- [The Picrew Downloader browser extension](https://github.com/mincerafter42/picrew-downloader), not very polished but functional; downloads the layered images from Picrew in OpenRaster format. Released 2021-04-18.
- I animated [a video about the PNG image format.](/assets/png.mp4). The script was text taken from the PNG website, was read by my friend flicky, and the music is by Kevin MacLeod, licensed under CC-BY. Published 2021-04-12.
- I took the Computer Programming class in my high school, and here is the best work I did from there. These are all Python 3 programs from circa 2021-03.
  - A [text adventure game where you play as a dragon meeting a human](/assets/python-for-school/dragon, by vivi.py). The _example_ shown to the class was a game where the player character was a human, and the only two outcomes were a dragon sharing treasure with them or a dragon eating them. I expanded on that.
  - A [sorting algorithm visualizer](/assets/python-for-school/vivi turtle sorting.py). It uses turtle graphics because that was the assignment, but I've added a text display because my laptop can't use Python turtle graphics. I went way overboard on this; the actual assignment was just to display the list before and after sorting.
  - A ["horoscope generator" (random phrase generator)](/assets/python-for-school/horoscope_Viatrix.py). The assignment was to make a random phrase generator with a theme, so I picked horoscopes and just made them super confident in wacky things.
- [No Setup Syndication](https://github.com/mincerafter42/no-setup-syndication), an RSS feed reader browser extension (it's not perfect but it had the functionality I wanted.) Released 2021-01-12.
- [The WordPress theme Chroma Park](https://wordpress.org/themes/chroma-park/), a modernized version of [Green Park from 2006](https://cordobo.com/free-wordpress-templates/cordobo-green-park/). This blog uses a variant of it. This blog doesn't use WordPress, so I converted the theme from a WordPress theme to a Jekyll theme while it was still being reviewed. Published 2021-01-07.
- I was on [a podcast hosted by my friend Maple](https://anchor.fm/maplestrip/episodes/Not-a-Date-at-the-Magic-Comic-Book-Shop-w-Viatrix-emq1ll). I don't remember most of what happened but that's cool. The episode was released 2020-11-20.
- I was the voice of a screaming person in [a 5-hour video](https://youtu.be/F_nL5d9lxJU) filled largely with screaming people (credited as mincerafter42 in the description). Video released 2020-09-03.
- [McJar Font Getter](https://github.com/mincerafter42/mcjarfontgetter), written in JavaScript, which seemed like a good idea at the time I guess? It turned the font in a Minecraft .jar file into an OTF font. Initial release 2020-07-15.
- Starting on 2020-04-17, I began making edits of [El Goonish Shive](https://egscomics.com) for humour. I traced [the font the author used](/assets/L.E.G.S.ttf), which was unavailable anywhere. On 2020-10-10 I began uploading [some of the edits to Reddit](https://i.reddit.com/search?q=author:mincerafter42+subreddit:elgoonishshiveedits)
- [The card game m…õkso](https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/m%C9%9Bkso), a game about maths. Published 2019-11-07.
- I made a YouTube channel on 2017-04-13 and published videos there, but I deleted the channel because I just didn't feel like distributing content on YouTube idk. Most of the content was not very good.
- I made stuff on [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu) starting 2016-02-27, but i kinda don't want to make my scratch account public because I was like 12 and way less skilled at programming than I am now.
