title: Link to Vivi's blog
---
Greetings! Are you perhaps a website owner of your own who wishes to include a snazzy link to my blog in your own website? Well this is the place _made_ for individuals matching those criteria.  
Others can view this page too, but what can you others do here really?

The link to my blog is <{{ site.url }}>.

Here's a cool 88Ã—31 button you can download and copy into your own blog as a link to my blog:  
![Vivi's blog](/assets/vivi-8831.png)  
<a href="/assets/vivi-8831.png" download>Download image (1752 bytes)</a>

If you are working with HTML, here is the code you would need to include this button in your blog:
```
<a href="{{ site.url }}">
	<img src="/assets/vivi-8831.png" alt="Vivi's blog">
</a>
```
Replace `/assets/vivi-8831.png` with the URL of your copy of the image.
