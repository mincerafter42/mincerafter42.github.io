<title>What's the "Yesterweb"?</title>
<main>
<h1>What's this "Yesterweb" thing?</h1>
<p>The Yesterweb was an online community of personal website builders.
One of the administrators, a self-proclaimed "digital guerilla", tried to turn it into an online community of Marxists who were neither yester nor web.
This largely failed, resulting in the Yesterweb shutting down in 2023.
<p>In the words of said administrator (with analogous components replaced by their literal meaning):
<blockquote cite=https://web.archive.org/web/1/https://forum.yesterweb.org/viewtopic.php?p=5103#p5103>
<p>We sold [websites] out of a [websites] truck.
<p>We realized [making websites] was making us sick and unhealthy so we introduced a healthier option: [Marxism]. We told everyone "we're going to keep selling [websites] but what we really want to do is make [Marxism], so please have some [Marxism]."
<p>Barely anyone wanted the [Marxism] and everyone was still [making] the [websites], so we worked for a while to explain to people why [making websites] was a bad idea. A few people listened but the majority continued to [make websites].
<p>We were getting sick and tired of selling [websites] so we told everyone "somebody else has to sell [websites] because we no longer want to do it." Nobody stepped up. A few people even tried to convince us to stop making [Marxism] and only sell [websites].
<p>We closed the [websites] section and told everyone that if they wanted [websites] they would have to get it somewhere else, from now on we are only selling [Marxism], come hang out with us and make [Marxism]. We were told "fuck you, I want [websites]!" Other [website] trucks moved in to take our customers and we don't care because we were done selling that garbage.
<p>The [Marxism] bar was still open, but we were still selling it from inside of an [websites] truck. People kept showing up expecting [websites] and even bringing their own [websites] and sharing it instead of making [Marxism].
<p>We decided to close the [websites] truck because it's misleading, and are asking people to start their own [Marxism] bars and truly reflect on why they like [websites] so much.
