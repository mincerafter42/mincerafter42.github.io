title: Sitely Content

"Sitely Content", that's an uncommon term.  
It was not invented by me, I found [the term Sitely Content](https://www.dragonflycave.com/kinds-of-content#sitely) on The Cave of Dragonflies.

Sitely content is website content that only exists because it is a website.

Sitely content on my site is [Site Setup](/site-setup), which describes the manner by which the site is available to view, and [Link to Vivi's blog](/link-to-me), which provides information for other website owners wishing to link to this very blog.
