Some webcomics I think are cool (in alphabetical order):
- [Aces Wild](https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/aces-wild/list?title_no=689025), an educational comic about asexuality.

[El Goonish Shive](https://egscomics.com),
a webcomic by Dan Shive that's been going since 2002. It has magic! And gender! Does it have magic genders? Not sure what that even means. Does it have gender-related magic? Yes. Does it have plot? Yes. Lots of plot. Does it have [an emotional page from 2014 that helped me and many others come out](https://www.egscomics.com/comic/2014-07-01)? Yes. The evolution of the comic has been generally regarded as "it gets better".
