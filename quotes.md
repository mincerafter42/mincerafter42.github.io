- remember kids, if there's both a CSS solution and a JS solution, take the CSS solution \*hops on a motorcycle and rides away into the sunset\* \*(in reality i am not licensed to operate any motor vehicle but just ignore that ok)\*
- ...i summarized my life from grade 2-12 because i recently reëstablished contact with a former grade 2 classmate and i realize i may sound incredibly overpowered in my summary  
  "i won a spelling contest without practicing lol"  
  "i ended up in a college-level Python course which was pretty easy lol"  
  "i hacked the blog system which all students had to use"  
  "i am immune to heartbreak"

  👩🏻‍🦱 *ゴゴゴゴゴゴゴ*  
  yep i feel like some sort of anime villain now lol  
  how is our plucky young hero going to defeat the Internet Rando Extraordinaire or whatever  
  what even is my villainous plan  
  imagining myself in a 90s anime just surrounded by beige desktops and typing on all their keyboards  
  and you bet my glasses somehow always have glare on them
- ok lemme explain this amazing plan i just invented:  
  i'm going to make a knockoff of Marriage  
  very similar product, but more gay and poly

  instead of a "wedding" you have an event that looks really similar to a wedding but it's not a wedding it's my &lt;s>completely original&lt;/s> product

  🤵‍♂️🤵🤵‍♀️👰‍♂️👰👰‍♀️

  ok so we make marriage 2 electric boogaloo like worthy of even more trust than marriage 1

  in addition to marriage 2 electric boogaloo rings, other options are marriage 2 electric boogaloo collars, marriage 2 electric boogaloo matching t-shirts, uhh i can't think of more ideas but there should definitely be more options in marriage 2 electric boogaloo (working title)

  marriage 2 electric boogaloo swords!

  everything is optional and nothing is exclusive

  except i guess if you're marrying 2 electric boogaloo, then the one non-optional thing is marrying 2 electric boogaloo itself, but only because we're acting under the assumption you already chose to marry 2 electric boogaloo
- i may have mothed so much that i'm mothing after mothers day is over
- near-homographic, by which i mean they're nearly spelled the same, not that they're nearly graphic gays
- it is clear i am not fluent in the language of eyes
- chirping is roleplaying the greek letter χ
- data strongly suggests the dictionary is a joke for humour purposes and never actually existed
- flurch frenting
- my fursona is an aspirin
- snakes and ladders has randomness but post office has neither  
  .. ok i meant neither randomness or skill  
  though it has neither snakes or ladders
- leap negative zeroths wouldn't make sense because then leap days would be anti-leap-minutes

- plot twist: strip scrabble turns out to be identical to regular scrabble because nobody knew when they were supposed to strip

## New passwords
A running joke I have is to claim phrases are my new password, based on [correct horse battery staple](https://xkcd.com/936/).

- "no Javascript whatsoever unlike other modern webring frameworks" is my new password
- "updated ezine egirl webring iframe background colour" is my new password
- 'current confirmed cuddler count' is very alliterative and is my new password :p
- "common character attribute combination" is my new password
- "can't independently determine blushworthiness" is my new password :p
- "syndication feed format history" and "image formats' internal intricacies" are my new passwords
- "tangentialy explained disinformation's etymology" is my new password
- equally calibred vernacular equivalents (which is also my new password)
- large thin flexible rectangle is my new password
- "rotating circle crisis averted" is my new password
- "attempted amplifying hat deformations" gives me "correct horse battery staple" vibes
