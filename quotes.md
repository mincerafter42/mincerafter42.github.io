- ...i summarized my life from grade 2-12 because i recently reëstablished contact with a former grade 2 classmate and i realize i may sound incredibly overpowered in my summary  
  "i won a spelling contest without practicing lol"  
  "i ended up in a college-level Python course which was pretty easy lol"  
  "i hacked the blog system which all students had to use"  
  "i am immune to heartbreak"

  👩🏻‍🦱 *ゴゴゴゴゴゴゴ*  
  yep i feel like some sort of anime villain now lol  
  how is our plucky young hero going to defeat the Internet Rando Extraordinaire or whatever  
  what even is my villainous plan  
  imagining myself in a 90s anime just surrounded by beige desktops and typing on all their keyboards  
  and you bet my glasses somehow always have glare on them
- ok lemme explain this amazing plan i just invented:  
  i'm going to make a knockoff of Marriage  
  very similar product, but more gay and poly

  instead of a "wedding" you have an event that looks really similar to a wedding but it's not a wedding it's my &lt;s>completely original&lt;/s> product

  🤵‍♂️🤵🤵‍♀️👰‍♂️👰👰‍♀️

  ok so we make marriage 2 electric boogaloo like worthy of even more trust than marriage 1

  in addition to marriage 2 electric boogaloo rings, other options are marriage 2 electric boogaloo collars, marriage 2 electric boogaloo matching t-shirts, uhh i can't think of more ideas but there should definitely be more options in marriage 2 electric boogaloo (working title)

  marriage 2 electric boogaloo swords!

  everything is optional and nothing is exclusive

  except i guess if you're marrying 2 electric boogaloo, then the one non-optional thing is marrying 2 electric boogaloo itself, but only because we're acting under the assumption you already chose to marry 2 electric boogaloo
- i may have mothed so much that i'm mothing after mothers day is over
- near-homographic, by which i mean they're nearly spelled the same, not that they're nearly graphic gays
- it is clear i am not fluent in the language of eyes
- chirping is roleplaying the greek letter χ
- data strongly suggests the dictionary is a joke for humour purposes and never actually existed
- flurch frenting
- my fursona is an aspirin
- snakes and ladders has randomness but post office has neither  
  .. ok i meant neither randomness or skill  
  though it has neither snakes or ladders
- leap negative zeroths wouldn't make sense because then leap days would be anti-leap-minutes

- plot twist: strip scrabble turns out to be identical to regular scrabble because nobody knew when they were supposed to strip
- legs being sexy is a myth made by pants companies to sell pants made with less fabric
- i didn't see any porn but i am now racing. against porn.
