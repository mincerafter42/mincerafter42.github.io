(Setup to this double joke: At the time, the <i>#newspaper</i> channel consisted entirely of
<a href=https://www.egscomics.com/comics/1391234446-fgs20140201.png>images of Susan accompanied by the text “So cool”</a>)
<blockquote>
<div><b>Rose</b>: The conversation in <i>#newspaper</i> is really solid today.</div>
<div><b>Rea</b>: I think you mean it's really <strong><em>cool</em></strong>.</div>
<div><b>Viatrix</b>: If it's cooler than the freezing point then it's solid</div>

<blockquote>
Oh my god that emoji looks so much like you<br>
I’ve never seen an emoji look so much like someone before, it’s a bit jarring

<item><description><![CDATA[for a while my brain's been shortcutting to a soundbyte “cartoons, cartoons, they're better than spoons”, which is most likely an accidental variation on Tom singing “harpoons, harpoons, they're better than spoons” in <i>Eddsworld</i>
<br>though whether cartoons are better than spoons might depend on what one means
<br><br>watching cartoons can be compared to watching the utensil <small>&lt;reference to="https://youtu.be/AYEm_JuV8AM"&gt;</small>cartoons are better at least until 2023<small>&lt;/reference&gt;</small>
<br>surely the act of spooning could be done while watching cartoons, potentially increasing overall enjoyment
<br>and spoons as a metaphor for energy are probably a required component for watching cartoons]]></description></item>
<item><description>i thought “to espouse” meant like “to declare enthusiastically” or thereabouts, but apparently it means “to become/get married to” and/or, the use which probably led to my interpretation, “to accept, support, or take on as one's own (an idea/cause)”

...i summarized my life from grade 2-12 because i recently reëstablished contact with a former grade 2 classmate and i realize i may sound incredibly overpowered in my summary
<br>“i won a spelling contest without practicing lol”
<br>“i ended up in a college-level Python course which was pretty easy lol”
<br>“i hacked the blog system which all students had to use”
<br>“i am immune to heartbreak”

<br>yep i feel like some sort of anime villain now lol

ok lemme explain this amazing plan i just invented:<br>
i'm going to make a knockoff of Marriage<br>
very similar product, but more gay and poly
<p>instead of a "wedding" you have an event that looks really similar to a wedding but it's not a wedding it's my &lt;s>completely original&lt;/s> product
<p>🤵‍♂️🤵🤵‍♀️👰‍♂️👰👰‍♀️
<p>ok so we make marriage 2 electric boogaloo like worthy of even more trust than marriage 1
<p>in addition to marriage 2 electric boogaloo rings, other options are marriage 2 electric boogaloo collars, marriage 2 electric boogaloo matching t-shirts, uhh i can't think of more ideas but there should definitely be more options in marriage 2 electric boogaloo (working title)
<p>marriage 2 electric boogaloo swords!
<p>everything is optional and nothing is exclusive
<p>except i guess if you're marrying 2 electric boogaloo, then the one non-optional thing is marrying 2 electric boogaloo itself, but only because we're acting under the assumption you already chose to marry 2 electric boogaloo

<li>"updated ezine egirl webring iframe background colour" is my new password
<li>'current confirmed cuddler count' is very alliterative and is my new password :p
<li>"common character attribute combination" is my new password
<li>"can't independently determine blushworthiness" is my new password :p
<li>"syndication feed format history" and "image formats' internal intricacies" are my new passwords
<li>"tangentialy explained disinformation's etymology" is my new password
<li>equally calibred vernacular equivalents (which is also my new password)
<li>large thin flexible rectangle is my new password
<li>"rotating circle crisis averted" is my new password

<br>(presumably the originator, from 2021-10-10)
