<h1>About the webmaster</h1>
<p id=name>
I'm Vivi. That's short for Viatrix, and long for Vi. Or, the absolute shortest, <strong>V</strong>.<br>
In the <abbr title="International Phonetic Alphabet">IPA</abbr> those are written as <span lang="en-fonipa">/ˈvi.jɐ.tɻɪks/</span>, <span lang="en-fonipa">/ˈvi.vi/</span>, <span lang="en-fonipa">/vi/</span> at least in my dialect.<br>
If you use diæreses in English, then my name would be written Viätrix because the I and A are parts of separate syllables.<br>
I'm also known as mincerafter42 on other platforms, so you can call me mincerafter42, mincerafter, or mince.
<p>
My pronouns are she|they. <a href=/labels>More about my titles and labels</a>
<p>
I was born on 2004-04-13<script>document.write("; I'm "+(new Date().getFullYear()-2004-(new Date().setMonth(3,13)>Date.now()))+' years old')</script>.
<p>
I like to make cool stuff. Usually this manifests digitally, as web development or other <a href=/portfolio>digital projects</a>, but can occasionally take the form of the physical.<br>
I also like spending time with my friends, cuddling, and surfing the Web. (All at the same time? Perhaps.)<br>
I am recreationally interested in linguistics (and who isn't these days, am I right? no; it's likely i'm just in a bubble of recreational linguists).
<p>
You can <a href=/contact>contact me via e-mail</a>.
